## Skills Acquired

-> Learnt about asynchronous functions, awaits and promises

-> Learnt how to build muy own command line tool using Node,js and certain libraries such as inquirer

-> Learnt how to deploy my project to npm (in this case I have deployed my project as an execuetable)

## Possible future developments

Look to expand the scope of questions asked as to allow different topics and for the end user to have more control over what type of questions are asked, i.e, being able to choose the topic they want,etc.
